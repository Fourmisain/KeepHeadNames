# Keep Head Names

A Fabric Minecraft mod that makes it so that player heads keep their display names and lore tags after being placed down and picked up again.<br>
It is an unofficial fix for [MC-174496](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-174496).

* requires Minecraft 1.16-1.18, Fabric Loader and Fabric API
* works server-only
* works in single player when installed on the client
* should be future-proof for when MC-174496 gets fixed
