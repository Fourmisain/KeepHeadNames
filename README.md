# Keep Head Names

A Fabric Minecraft mod that makes it so that player heads keep their display names after being placed down and picked up again.<br>
It is an unofficial fix for [MC-174496](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-174496).

* requires Minecraft 1.16.2+, Fabric Loader 0.11.1+ and Fabric API
* works server-only
* works in single player when installed on the client
* should be future proof for when MC-174496 gets fixed
